# AI-Powered-Interview-System
build a functional prototype of an AI-driven interview system. The prototype should include basic AI integration for context, question generation and speech-to-text capabilities to simulate a realistic user experience. This project is intended to serve as a proof of concept for a more complex application we plan to develop.

Project Scope:

AI-Driven Interview Module:
Implement a system that dynamically generates interview questions using an AI language model (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) based on different input variables/context.
Questions should adapt based on user responses, providing a simulated AI-driven conversation.
Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text Integration:
Integrate a text-to-speech and speech-to-text API (e.g., Google Cloud Speech-to-Text) to allow users to get questions by AI voice and respond to questions using their voice.
Display transcribed responses in real-time within the user interface.
User Interface (UI):
Develop a simple and intuitive web-based UI using React (or another suitable frontend framework) where users can interact with the app.
Include basic controls for starting the debrief, submitting responses, and viewing the progress of the conversation.
Backend API:
Develop a backend service (using Node.js/Express or Python/Flask) to handle requests for AI question generation and manage the debrief flow.
Implement RESTful endpoints to interact with the frontend and integrate with the AI and speech-to-text services.
Session Management:
Track the state of the debrief session, including user responses and the current question, to ensure a smooth and logical debrief flow.
Basic Reporting:
Generate a simple text report at the end of the debrief that summarizes the user’s responses and the AI’s questions in a structured format.

Technical Requirements:

Frontend:
Strong experience with React, Vue.js, or similar frontend frameworks.
Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Experience with integrating third-party APIs (e.g., speech-to-text).
Backend:
Proficiency in Node.js/Express or Python/Flask.
Experience with RESTful API development and integrating AI models (OpenAI API or similar).
AI Integration:

Familiarity with OpenAI’s GPT-3/4 or similar language models.
Voice Integration:
Experience with speech-to-text services like Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or similar.
Knowledge of real-time data handling in web applications.

Deliverables:

A functional prototype hosted on a staging server, demonstrating the full interview workflow.
Source code with documentation, including instructions for deployment and setup.
A brief report summarizing the development process and any key decisions or challenges encountered.
============
To build a functional prototype of an AI-driven interview system with speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities, we can break the solution into several components:
Key Components:

    Frontend: A simple UI built using React (or another frontend framework) for user interaction.
    Backend: A RESTful API built with Node.js/Express or Flask (Python) that handles AI question generation, speech-to-text, and manages session flow.
    AI Integration: Use OpenAI GPT-3/4 for dynamic question generation based on context and user responses.
    Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech: Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for converting user speech to text and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech to read AI-generated questions aloud.

Below is a Python-based solution using Flask for the backend, OpenAI GPT-3 for generating questions, and Google Cloud APIs for speech-to-text and text-to-speech integration.
1. Frontend (React) Setup

npx create-react-app interview-app
cd interview-app
npm install axios react-speech-recognition

Basic React UI to interact with the backend (you can extend this UI as needed):

// src/App.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";
import SpeechRecognition, { useSpeechRecognition } from "react-speech-recognition";

function App() {
  const [question, setQuestion] = useState("");
  const [response, setResponse] = useState("");
  const [sessionId, setSessionId] = useState("");
  
  const { transcript, resetTranscript } = useSpeechRecognition();

  const startInterview = async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.post("http://localhost:5000/start_interview");
    setSessionId(data.session_id);
    setQuestion(data.question);
  };

  const submitResponse = async () => {
    const { data } = await axios.post("http://localhost:5000/submit_response", {
      session_id: sessionId,
      response: transcript
    });
    setResponse(data.response);
    resetTranscript();
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>AI Interview System</h1>
      <button onClick={startInterview}>Start Interview</button>
      <div>
        <p>{question}</p>
        <button onClick={SpeechRecognition.startListening}>Listen to Question</button>
        <p>Transcript: {transcript}</p>
        <button onClick={submitResponse}>Submit Response</button>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>{response}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

2. Backend (Flask) Setup

First, install the necessary libraries for Flask, OpenAI, and Google Cloud:

pip install Flask openai google-cloud-speech google-cloud-texttospeech

Then, create the Flask app:

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import openai
from google.cloud import speech, texttospeech
import uuid
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Set your OpenAI and Google Cloud credentials
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path_to_your_google_credentials.json"

# Initialize Google Cloud clients
speech_client = speech.SpeechClient()
text_to_speech_client = texttospeech.TextToSpeechClient()

# Store session data
sessions = {}

def generate_ai_question(context):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # or GPT-4 if available
        prompt=f"Generate a job interview question based on this context: {context}",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

@app.route('/start_interview', methods=['POST'])
def start_interview():
    session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    question = generate_ai_question("Tell me about yourself.")  # Initial question, can adapt based on context
    sessions[session_id] = {"question": question, "responses": []}
    return jsonify({"session_id": session_id, "question": question})

@app.route('/submit_response', methods=['POST'])
def submit_response():
    data = request.json
    session_id = data.get("session_id")
    response = data.get("response")
    
    # Save the user's response and generate a follow-up question
    sessions[session_id]["responses"].append(response)
    next_question = generate_ai_question(response)  # Adapt the next question based on the response

    # Send the AI's response back to the user
    return jsonify({"response": next_question})

@app.route('/speech_to_text', methods=['POST'])
def speech_to_text():
    audio_file = request.files['audio']
    audio_content = audio_file.read()

    # Speech-to-Text API request
    audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=audio_content)
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code="en-US"
    )
    response = speech_client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)

    # Extract the transcript from the speech-to-text response
    transcript = response.results[0].alternatives[0].transcript
    return jsonify({"transcript": transcript})

@app.route('/text_to_speech', methods=['POST'])
def text_to_speech():
    text = request.json.get("text")
    
    # Text-to-Speech API request
    input_text = texttospeech.SynthesisInput(text=text)
    voice = texttospeech.VoiceSelectionParams(
        language_code="en-US", ssml_gender=texttospeech.SsmlVoiceGender.NEUTRAL
    )
    audio_config = texttospeech.AudioConfig(audio_encoding=texttospeech.AudioEncoding.MP3)
    response = text_to_speech_client.synthesize_speech(input=input_text, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config)

    # Return the audio content to the frontend
    return jsonify({"audio_content": response.audio_content.decode("ISO-8859-1")})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Key Components:

    AI Question Generation: The generate_ai_question function uses OpenAI's GPT model to dynamically generate a question based on context. This context can evolve as the user progresses through the interview.

    Speech-to-Text Integration: The speech_to_text endpoint takes an audio file (user's spoken response) and converts it into text using Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API.

    Text-to-Speech Integration: The text_to_speech endpoint converts AI-generated text responses into speech using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API.

    Session Management: The sessions dictionary stores the state of each interview session, including the current question and user responses, using a unique session ID for each user.

3. Setting Up Google Cloud APIs

To use Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs, you need to:

    Set up a Google Cloud project.
    Enable the Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech APIs.
    Download the credentials JSON file and set it as the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS.

4. Running the Prototype

    Run Flask Backend:

python app.py

Run React Frontend:

    npm start

    Open your browser to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the AI-driven interview system.

Conclusion

This prototype includes the core functionalities needed to simulate an AI-driven interview system. It can dynamically generate interview questions, allow users to respond with their voice, and provide AI-generated feedback. You can scale this up by improving the context-awareness of AI, adding more advanced features, and deploying the app to a cloud environment.
